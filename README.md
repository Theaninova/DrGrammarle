# The most annoying Discord bot on the planet
Who is Dr. Grämmarle?

Dr. Grämmarle is a modern day real-life hero. Swooping through the channels of Discord, purging his way
to put balance to the Force. Language is a art not everyone is capable of using correctly. In the past, we had
to manually correct everyone who would have the audacity to misuse it, but now, technology is taking over.

Coming from a secret German research facility in the Arctic, a project they don't want you to know about
is about to revolutionize the internet as we know it.

## What was before

From the ashes of IRC, the towers of Twitter to the deep abysses of the YouTube comment section, there
always has been a group of rebellious people who defend our sacred language. A group of superior people, with
elevated intellect trying to give the dumb ones a taste of what it's like to be intelligent. A tedious
work that was putting them to the absolute limits.

## What comes next

The year is 0 AH. Germany is entirely occupied by the Allies. Well, not entirely...
One small research facility of indomitable Nazis still holds out against the invaders.
And life is not easy for the Allied soldiers who garrison the fortified camps of Сука блять, La Vache,
Barqa King and Oliver Tea...

This facility under the lead of Dr. Josef Grämmarle was working on a weapon so powerful, no one ever though
it would see the light of day.
One bot to find them, to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.

It was the chosen one. The one to bring balance to the force, and bring peace to the chatrooms across the
Weltnetz. It was thought to be too powerful for even the most experienced people to handle. But it was all different.
Instead of helping the intelligent ones obliterate and enslave the populus, it was helping the proletariat to overcome
bourgeoisie. For over 70 years, it has been held in a secret American facility. Until one day one brave soldier
decided it would be enough of the suppression.

A hero of the socialist world, he took the bot, and released it to the internet, free for everyone to use,
and to break the chains of stupidity.
